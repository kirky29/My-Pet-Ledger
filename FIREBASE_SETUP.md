# Firebase & Firestore Integration Guide

This guide will help you complete the Firebase and Firestore integration for your Animal Tracking App.

## 🚀 What's Been Done

✅ **Firebase SDK Integration**
- Firebase configuration file created (`lib/firebase.ts`)
- Firebase package installed
- Firestore database and Authentication set up

✅ **Authentication System**
- Complete authentication system with login/signup pages
- Password reset functionality
- User profile management in navigation
- Route protection for authenticated users only

✅ **New Data Layer**
- Complete Firestore data service created (`lib/firestore-data.ts`)
- All existing functionality migrated to use Firestore
- API routes updated to use Firestore instead of local JSON files
- User-specific data isolation (each user sees only their own animals)

✅ **Security Rules**
- Firestore security rules created (`firestore.rules`)
- User-based access control implemented
- Secure data isolation between users

✅ **Migration Script**
- Data migration utility created (`scripts/migrate-to-firestore.js`)
- Handles migration from local JSON files to Firestore

## 🔧 Setup Steps

### 1. Deploy Firestore Security Rules

You need to deploy the security rules to your Firebase project:

```bash
# Install Firebase CLI if you haven't already
npm install -g firebase-tools

# Login to Firebase
firebase login

# Initialize Firebase in your project (choose Firestore)
firebase init firestore

# Deploy the security rules
firebase deploy --only firestore:rules
```

### 2. Migrate Existing Data (Optional)

If you have existing data in local JSON files that you want to preserve:

```bash
# Run the migration script
node scripts/migrate-to-firestore.js
```

This will:
- Transfer all animals from `data/animals.json` to Firestore
- Transfer settings from `data/settings.json` to Firestore
- Clean up data format for Firestore compatibility

### 3. Test Your Application

Start your application and test all functionality:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Test the following features:
- ✅ User authentication (login/signup/logout)
- ✅ Password reset functionality
- ✅ View all animals (user-specific)
- ✅ Add new animals
- ✅ Edit existing animals
- ✅ Add events to animals
- ✅ Update settings
- ✅ All CRUD operations
- ✅ Data isolation between users

## 🗂️ Firestore Data Structure

Your data is organized in Firestore as follows:

```
📁 animals/
  📄 {animalId}
    - id: string
    - userId: string (Firebase Auth UID)
    - name: string
    - species: string
    - events: array
    - weight: array
    - height: array
    - ownerInfo: object
    - createdAt: timestamp
    - updatedAt: timestamp
    - ... (other animal fields)

📁 settings/
  📄 user-settings-{userId}
    - currency: object
    - fieldOptions: object
    - display: object
    - notifications: object
    - createdAt: timestamp
    - updatedAt: timestamp
```

## 🔒 Security Rules

The security rules (`firestore.rules`) now implement proper user-based access control:

```javascript
rules_version = '2';
service cloud.firestore {
  match /databases/{database}/documents {
    // Animals - users can only access their own animals
    match /animals/{animalId} {
      allow read, write: if request.auth != null && request.auth.uid == resource.data.userId;
      allow create: if request.auth != null && request.auth.uid == request.resource.data.userId;
    }
    
    // Settings - users can only access their own settings
    match /settings/{settingsId} {
      allow read, write: if request.auth != null && settingsId == ('user-settings-' + request.auth.uid);
    }
  }
}
```

**Key Security Features:**
- Users must be authenticated to access any data
- Each user can only see and modify their own animals
- Settings are isolated per user
- Complete data segregation between users

## 🔄 Key Changes Made

### API Routes Updated:
- `/api/animals` - Now uses Firestore
- `/api/animals/[id]` - Now uses Firestore  
- `/api/animals/[id]/events` - Now uses Firestore
- `/api/animals/[id]/events/[eventId]` - Now uses Firestore
- `/api/settings` - Now uses Firestore

### Pages Updated:
- `app/animals/[id]/edit/page.tsx` - Uses Firestore data layer
- `app/layout.tsx` - Wrapped with authentication providers
- `components/Navigation.tsx` - Added user profile and logout

### New Pages Created:
- `app/auth/login/page.tsx` - User login page
- `app/auth/signup/page.tsx` - User registration page  
- `app/auth/reset-password/page.tsx` - Password reset page

### New Components Created:
- `lib/auth-context.tsx` - Authentication context provider
- `components/ProtectedRoute.tsx` - Route protection component
- `components/AuthWrapper.tsx` - Authentication wrapper

### New Files Created:
- `lib/firebase.ts` - Firebase configuration with Auth
- `lib/firestore-data.ts` - Firestore data service with user isolation
- `firestore.rules` - User-based security rules
- `scripts/migrate-to-firestore.js` - Migration utility

## 🚨 Important Notes

1. **Environment Variables**: For production, consider moving Firebase config to environment variables
2. **Security**: Update security rules before deploying to production
3. **Backup**: The migration script doesn't delete local files - keep them as backup
4. **Performance**: Firestore queries are optimized for the app's current usage patterns
5. **Costs**: Monitor Firestore usage in Firebase Console to track costs

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:

**"Permission denied" errors:**
- Check that security rules are deployed
- Verify Firebase project configuration

**"Network request failed":**
- Ensure Firebase project is active
- Check internet connection
- Verify API keys are correct

**Migration fails:**
- Ensure local data files exist
- Check Firebase permissions
- Verify project configuration

## 📞 Next Steps

1. **Deploy security rules** (required)
2. **Set up Firebase Authentication** (if not already done):
   - Go to Firebase Console → Authentication → Sign-in method
   - Enable "Email/Password" provider
3. **Test the authentication system**:
   - Try creating a new account
   - Test login/logout functionality
   - Verify password reset works
4. **Run migration script** (if you have existing data)
5. **Test the application** thoroughly with multiple user accounts
